üëã Hey there, I'm Sahil Modi

I‚Äôm an aspiring Data Scientist and Cybersecurity Enthusiast, currently pursuing my B.Voc in Software Development with a CGPA of 9.6. I‚Äôm deeply interested in exploring how data, AI, and cybersecurity can come together to create real-world impact. My ultimate goal is to work as a Data Scientist at Google and build meaningful tech solutions that make a difference.

I have hands-on experience in web development and backend technologies. I‚Äôve built a few projects, including EHR 360, an electronic health record management system, and MediReach, a platform that connects medical donors and NGOs with people in need.

I enjoy working with technologies like React, Node.js, Firebase, AWS, and MongoDB, and I‚Äôm constantly learning new tools and frameworks to improve my skills. My technical interests revolve around data analysis, cybersecurity, and AI/ML.

Here‚Äôs a bit more about what I work with:

Languages: Python, Java, C, C++, PHP, JavaScript

Web Development: React, Node.js, Firebase, HTML, CSS

Databases: MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase Firestore

Cloud: AWS (EC2, Amplify, S3, DynamoDB), Vercel

Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman, Figma

My short-term goal is to strengthen my foundation in data science and machine learning, and long-term, I plan to pursue a Master‚Äôs in Data Science, ideally in Germany or Singapore.

Outside of tech, I‚Äôm a professionally trained Hindustani classical singer. Music keeps me grounded and creative, and I love finding ways to blend art with technology.

I‚Äôm always curious, always learning, and I believe in growing through exploration and experience.
